# spanish-colemak-qwerty-macos

Keyboard layout for macOS that is Colemak for typing letters, but can be used to type Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, and Hungarian as well.

This layout behaves like QWERTY when typing shortcuts. Ie, your usual shortcuts like command-T, command-F will all work with the same QWERTY locations you are used to.

### Spanish / Español

* `á` = `;a`
* `é` = `;e`
* `í` = `;i`
* `ó` = `;o`
* `ú` = `;u`
* `ý` = `;y`
* `ñ` = `;n`

### French / Français

* `ç` = `;c`
* Letters with grave: `à` = `;ta`
* Letters with circumflex: `â` = `;la`
* Letters with umlaut: `ë` = `;ve`

### Portuguese / Português

* Letters with tilde: `ã` = `;xa`

### German / Deutsch

* `ß` = `;b`
* `ö` = `;s`
* `ü` = `;r`
* `ä` = `;p`

### Hungarian / Magyar

* `ő` = `;f`
* `ű` = `;w` (both qwerty and colemak)

### Punctuation, non-accented characters, uppercase, colemak

Non-accented characters can be typed as usual. To type `;` itself, use `;;`. For uppercase characters, replace the last character with uppercase. So `Á` = `;A`, `À` = `;tA`
